IBM has released a commercial quantum computer with the [IBM Quantum experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and Google has demonstrated a [quantum computer has an advantage over a classical computer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5) for the problem of sampling from a specific probability distribution.\n",

This will include everything: qubits frequencies, the controls we apply to the system,  as well as the noises that come from the environment. To find out how a qubit evolves we need to solve Schrödinger's equation, this in general can be really challenging with time-dependent noisy Hamiltonians. Fortunately, BOULDER OPAL can solve Schrödinger's equation for us, to learn more see the [Simulate dynamics user guide](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/simulate-quantum-dynamics).\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect Schrödinger's equation to quantum gates, we can use one more trick. Quantum mechanics also states that any evolution of a quantum state can be described with a unitary transformation, so we can replace the dynamics of our state with the dynamics of a unitary transformation $\\vert\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) \\vert\\psi(0)\\rangle$. Replacing this in Schrödinger's equation gives us an equation which we can solve to get a quantum gate:\n",

    "An ideal superconducting qubit has just two levels, labeled $\\lvert0\\rangle$ and $\\lvert1\\rangle$. These states refer to different physical states of the superconducting qubits. Depending on how the qubit is built, these labels will refer to the changing charge, flux or phase of the superconducting circuit (for more info see [Superconducting quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing)). In all cases this quantity becomes quantized and the lowest two energetic levels are what we call the $\\lvert0\\rangle$ and $\\lvert1\\rangle$ states. Note that more realistic superconducting qubits can have more than two levels and this can result in leakage (for more info see [Single qubit with leakage](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/simulate-quantum-dynamics#Example-Single-qubit-with-leakage)).\n",

    "On a real quantum computer you only get access to the projective measurements not direct access to the unitary. There are many techniques out there to try and estimate the unitary or its quality (Have a look at [quantum tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tomography) or [randomized benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_benchmarking)), but they tend to take a lot of measurements and require many assumptions. \n",

We start by making a function that, given a list of measurements 1 and 0, estimates the probability that a 1 would be returned, and an error in that estimate (assuming the central limit theorem). We apply this method to the results we previously got."

    "However the problem here is that the precision on the error for the H gate, on the order of $10^{-16}$ is much much smaller than our standard error estimate, on the order of $10^{-2}$. Taking more measurements might give us a more precise answer. But the precision of the standard error scales poorly with the number of measurements $M$, as it goes as $1/\\sqrt{M}$. So that's little reward for a lot more measurements. Furthermore, if we have additional errors like State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) errors (which we will introduce latter) things might scale even worse."

    "#### Repetition makes perfect\n",

    "The solution to this problem is the extra input to the `simulate_ideal_qubit` method,  the `repetition`. In a real experiment we can repeat a pulse to implement a gate multiple times before we measure. If we repeat a gate, we can effectively boost the error signal. For example, consider repeating an imperfect H gate 101 times, if it was perfect we would still expect to get a 1 with probability 0.5, but if there was a small error $\\epsilon$ on the gate, we would expect to get a 1 with probability $0.5 + 101 \\epsilon$. Hence we can use repetition to effective boost the signal of our error!\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In realistic superconducting devices the Rabi rate that you drive the qubit with is not normally known. Instead you normally set some voltages on your microwave signal generator and you have to figure out how they relate to the Rabi rate. These are usually normalized between -1 and 1. To learn how to determine the Rabi rate of your qubit have a look at the [Pulse calibration application note](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/application-notes/control-hardware-pulse-calibration).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One step we didn't talk about is tuning your microwave on resonance with your superconducting qubit. Even after tuning your microwave drive to be on resonance with your microwave drive, there might be a small detuning error that can drift slowly over time. This manifests as an extra term in the Hamiltonian that looks like:\n",

    "    \\frac{H(t)}{\\hbar} = \\epsilon_D(t) b^\\dagger b + \\frac{1}{2} \\Omega(t) b + \\frac{1}{2} \\Omega(t) b^\\dagger \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    For most experiments this $\\epsilon_D(t)$ changes so slowly that they can be treated as effectively constant for a single experiment.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Even after calibrating your Rabi rate, there can also be a small amplitude error in the $I$ and $Q$ channels that make up your complex Rabi rate. These errors can be independent and look like:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\frac{H(t)}{\\hbar} = \\frac{1}{2} (I(t)(1 + \\epsilon_I(t)) + Q(t)(1 + \\epsilon_Q(t))) b + \\mbox{ h. c. } \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where h. c. means hermitian conjugate of the previous term. Again, $\\epsilon_I(t)$ and $\\epsilon_Q(t)$ change so slowly that they can be basically treated as effectively constant for a single experiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. When using superconducting qubits, microwaves are typically sent down control lines that have bandwidth limits. This means that signals with sudden changes tend not to work very well when used on a real device. We can add these bandwidth limits onto any control lines in BOULDER OPAL using the linear filter feature. To learn more about this feature have a look at the [Pulse optimization under realistic experimental constraints application note](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/application-notes/control-hardware-pulse-optimization-under-realistic-experimental-constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Another critical issue on quantum computers is state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. These occur when the qubit is not perfectly prepared in the ground state at the beginning of computation, this often gets worse when the quantum computer heats up. There can also be many errors introduced during the measurement state. Superconducting qubits make measurements by driving a resonator that is coupled to the qubit, the state of the qubit affects the frequency of the resonator, which allows us to read out the qubits state. This process is not perfect and sometimes a 1 is incorrectly detected as a 0 and vice versa. These errors are best modeled using a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix).

    "### Quantum Control Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to use quantum control to improve the performance of a realistic qubit. Here we present three major approaches with a brief discussion of the advantages and disadvantages. It's up to you to decide which approach interests you the most! We recommend trying the control technique you're going to apply to the more realistic qubit above first, then when you understand how it works, try applying it to the qubit in the cloud for the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal control is best used when you have a detailed model of the system you are trying to improve. To start you might want to assume that you already have a detailed model of the more realistic qubit presented above. You can then follow the instructions in the [Optimize controls user guide](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/optimize-controls) which explains how to optimize any quantum system that you can program as a graph. If you have a good model, optimal control will typically be the quickest path to get a high fidelity gate. However when you're working with a real device, you normally don't have perfect knowledge of your system's Hamiltonian, and often parameters in your system, like the Rabi rate, can slowly drift over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to try and apply optimal control to a real qubit, you'll also need an accurate model. BOULDER OPAL has system identification feature, described in the [System identification application note](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/application-notes/control-hardware-system-identification) that allows you to identify the terms in a Hamiltonian, which can then be used to derive optimized control. System identification can be problematic when using noisy results, so only take this on if you like a real challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robust Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust control is best used when you have partial knowledge of the system you are trying to improve. For example, you may know that you have a qubit undergoing dephasing and amplitude errors and that there is some bandwidth limit on the control lines. In this case you can design a control that achieves a high fidelity operation even if you don't exactly know what the current dephasing or amplitude errors are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great place to start with this approach is the [Incorporating smoothing via linear filters on control signals example](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/optimize-controls#Example-Incorporating-smoothing-via-linear-filters-on-control-signals) in the [Optimize controls user guide](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/optimize-controls). This shows you how to optimize a pulse which is robust to dephasing and band-limited. If you also would like an example of adding amplitude error robustness have a look at the [CRAB Optimization example](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/optimize-controls#Example-CRAB-optimization) in the same notebook. You don't need any knowledge of the Rabi rate to design robust pulses to dephasing and amplitude errors. Furthermore, as long as you set the bandwidth of filter low enough when optimizing the pulse, you won't be affected by bandwidth limits on your control lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you actually want to test a robust control pulse you will need to calibrate it. This process is detailed in the [Pulse calibration application note](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/application-notes/control-hardware-pulse-calibration). \n",
    "\n",
    "A great overview of this approach applied to improve the performance of a real qubit accessed through the IBM Quantum Experience is in the [Suppressing errors on real quantum computers webinar](https://youtu.be/WabKiPoBF4Y), which can be found in the [Q-CTRL learning center](https://q-ctrl.com/learning-center/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning control\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning control, also often called closed-loop automated optimization, is a different approach to both optimal and robust control. It does not assume a model of the qubit at all. Instead, closed-loop automated optimization can be used to directly learn the best control from the qubit itself. The best place to get started with this approach is the [Automated closed-loop hardware optimization of quantum devices user guide](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/user-guides/automate-closed-loop-hardware-optimization-of-quantum-devices). This gives an overview of using automated optimization to improve the performance of a simulated qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing closed-loop automated optimization it is very important that you pick the right cost function for the automated optimization algorithm. You should review the \"Repetition makes perfect\" section to learn how to effectively estimate the fidelity of a unitary from realistic projective measurements from a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great overview of this approach applied to improve the performance of a real qubit accessed through the IBM Quantum Experience is in the [Suppressing errors on real quantum computers webinar](https://youtu.be/WabKiPoBF4Y), which can be found in the [Q-CTRL learning center](https://q-ctrl.com/learning-center/). Q-CTRL has implemented some sophisticated machine learning algorithms under the hood to ensure our automated optimization routines converge as quickly as possible, to learn more about other experiments our automated optimization features has been used on you should watch the [Automated closed-loop optimization webinar](https://youtu.be/CRWVmoqTen4)."
